    "# Intraday Mean-Reverting Pairs Trading Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this strategy, we will focus on a pairs trading strategy between two ETFs, SPY, and IWM, which represent the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will calculate a hedge ratio (long #: short #) between the two ETFs in order to generate a spread that will (hopefully) revert back to the mean. We will be utilizing a z-score in order to provide a benchmark to compare the performance of the ETFs on, with long signals being generated when the z-score drops between a determined threshold, and short signals generated when z-score raises above a determined threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Claim: Since the SPY and IWM are based on similar indices that take into account large-cap and small-cap domestic stocks, we believe that the long-term patterns of both ETFs are cointegrated. As a result, over a long period of time, both should revert to the mean if any changes occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the claim of them being cointegrated, as well as the viability of the strategy, including the strategy spread and cointegration factor. We will not be taking into account any transaction costs or biases in this initial stage, since we want to simplify the calculations and test if this strategy is even remotely viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: 1-minute bars of SPY and IWM, from August 2010 to August 2017.\n",
    "Spread: We calculate via a rolling linear regression, which a lookback window of k bars.\n",
    "Z-Score: Calculated normally, subtracting by the sample mean of the spread and dividing by the standard deviation (not taking into account lookahead bias).\n",
    "Trades: Signals will be generated with an entry threshold z-score = 2 | -2, and exit threshold z = 1 | -1"
